## Summary of the Project
*We decided to work on the duckieTown project. The goal of our project is to develop an intelligence system for duckie-bot and allow it to self-navigate in the “Town” using reinforcement learning and machine learning. We will focus on developing a simulation duckieTown and deploying a machine-learning-based solution to train our duckie-bot to detect the lanes, follow the lanes, recognize the signals, stop or/and avoid collision with other objects such as walls, trees, buses, etc;  and respond to different factors quickly. 
We will buy or self-create a duckie-bot with a camera to sensor data (depending on the situation). The duckie-bot should be able to drive (accelerate), stop, and turn.
This is a very new and interesting project for us, we believe that this project will greatly improve our knowledge and working ability. We are committed to coordinating with team members to carry out this project in the best possible way.

## Machine Learning Algorithms
*For my project, I anticipate using "Deep Q-Networks (DQN), Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCN)" as primary methods, focusing on reinforcement learning with model-free, off-policy approaches for control tasks and leveraging DCNs for perception.*

## Evaluation Plan
*For evaluation plan, we split it into two phrases: Simulation Evaluation, and Real-World Duckie-bot Evaluation.
SIMULATION EVALUATION
For the simulation, we use duckieTown dataset to train and test. The metric should include lane detaction accuracy, collision avoidance, respond accuracy to traffic signals.REAL-WORLD DUCKIE-BOT
After all the train and test are going to be as plan (good simulation). We plan to purchase a Duckie-bot which is around $150 from online store.
The evaluation metrics for this step include the bot's ability to follow the lanes accuracy, avoid obstacles such as buses, walls, houses,..., respond to traffic lights.

## Plan to Meet Course Instructor
*I plan to meet the course instructor on Week 3 to discuss and get suggestions for the project plan, on Week 5 for the mandatory check-in, and on Week 9 for the mandatory final review.*

## AI Usage
*I intend to use the OpenAI Gym for reinforcement learning simulations and environments, PyTorch for implementing and training neural networks, and possibly TensorFlow for experimenting with alternative architectures if needed. Additionally, I may explore Duckietown-specific libraries and tools for seamless integration with the simulator and Duckie-Bot*
