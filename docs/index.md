# Welcome to Our Duckietown Project 🚗💨  

This project focuses on developing an intelligent **self-driving DuckieBot** using **reinforcement learning**. Our goal is to train a DuckieBot to navigate autonomously within a simulated town, recognizing lanes, signals, and avoiding collisions using **PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) and SAC (Soft Actor-Critic)**.
