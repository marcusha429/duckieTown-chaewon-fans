# Project Overview
We‚Äôre bringing reinforcement learning to DuckieTownü¶Ü by training a duckiebot to navigate an ever-changing environment filled with stationary and moving obstaclesüöß. Our purpose is to showcase how advanced RL algorithms‚ÄîProximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)‚Äîthrive in continuous control tasks requiring pinpoint precisionüéØ. Our goals include applying theoretical RL in real-world scenarios, pushing the boundaries of safe and efficient deployment, and documenting each exhilarating step of our progress. Key features include dynamic obstacle avoidance, robust policy learning, and the potential for real-life domain transfer via Sim2Real‚ö°Ô∏è ‚Äî so stay tuned for our journey that combines cutting-edge algorithms with practical, hands-on robotics!

[Link to Source Code Repository](https://github.com/marcusha429/duckietown-chaewon-fans/tree/main)

`ppo_project_code` directory: Holds all the main scripts and configurations for training and evaluating a reinforcement learning agent in the **Duckietown-loop_empty-v0** environment. Inside, you‚Äôll find example training files, logs, and job submission scripts demonstrating how to run **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** in a simple DuckieTown loop map‚Äîboth headlessly or with rendering. It's a self-contained starting point for exploring RL in DuckieTown using PPOüöó!
